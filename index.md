# About Me.

I'm currently studying Cybersecurity with a focus on network defense, ethical hacking, and information security. With a strong interest in how digital systems can be protected from threats, I'm building a foundation in core topics like threat analysis, vulnerability assessment, and incident response.

I'm exploring tools and platforms such as Wireshark, Kali Linux, Metasploit, and Splunk, and actively working toward certifications like CompTIA Security+, CompTIA A+, CompTIA CySA+, CompTIA Linux

My goal is to transition into a role in cyber defense, security operations, or risk analysis, where I can apply my technical skills to solve real-world security challenges.

Always open to connecting with professionals in the cybersecurity field and learning from industry mentors.
